            <h2>A Passion for Making Things Work Better</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm **Won Jung**. For my entire career, I've been fascinated by a single question: "How can we make this process smarter, faster and more efficient?" That core passion is what Industrial Engineering means to me, and it's a journey I'm still on.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site is my new 'project.' It's my digital home to share the ideas, research, and practical projects I've been fortunate to be a part of. My career as a professor and Dean at Daegu University, and as a consultant for industry leaders like Samsung and Hyundai, has always been about one thing: bridging the gap between academic theory and real-world results.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're also passionate about smart manufacturing, reliable systems, or just the art of solving complex problems, you're in the right place. Welcome.
            </p>
